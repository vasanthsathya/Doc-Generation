# network_spec.yml

This file defines all network segments used by the Omnia cluster: admin, ib, and additional networks. Each network is described as an entry in the
`Networks` list.

## Top-level structure

`network_spec.yml` contains a single top-level key, `Networks`, which is a
YAML list of network definitions.

```yaml title="File: /opt/omnia/main/input/project_default/network_spec.yml"
Networks:
  - admin_network:
      ...
  - ib_network:
      ...
  - additional_subnets:
      ...
```
## Admin Network Configuration Parameters
--8<-- "html/network_spec-admin_network.html"

## Infiniband Network Configuration Parameters (optional)
--8<-- "html/network_spec-ib_network.html"

## Additional Subnets Configuration Parameters (optional)
--8<-- "html/network_spec-additional_subnets.html"


## Usage example

```yaml title="File: /opt/omnia/main/input/project_default/network_spec.yml"

      router: "172.16.107.254"
      dynamic_range: "172.16.107.201-172.16.107.250"
      dns: []

  - ib_network:
      subnet: "192.168.0.0"
      netmask_bits: "24"
      dns: []

  - additional_subnets:
      - subnet: "10.40.1.0"
        netmask_bits: "24"
        router: "10.40.1.1"
        dynamic_range: "10.40.1.100-10.40.1.200"
      - subnet: "10.40.3.0"
        netmask_bits: "24"
        router: "10.40.3.1"
        dynamic_range: "10.40.3.100-10.40.3.200"
```


!!! note

    - The `router` field is optional and specifies the gateway IP address for the admin network. The configured value is advertised to nodes via DHCP as their default gateway.
    - In connected deployments, set `router` to the external rack gateway (such as a SONiC switch) which provides connectivity beyond the rack network.
    - In air-gapped deployments, set `router` to the OIM's IP address if the OIM is acting as the rack gateway. If a dedicated router or gateway is available, specify its IP address instead.
    - Default value: `172.16.107.254`
    - In LOM topology, `admin_network` and `bmc_network` may share the
      same `oim_nic_name` with different `vlan_id` values.
    - The `dynamic_range` must not overlap with any static IPs assigned
      in the PXE mapping file.
