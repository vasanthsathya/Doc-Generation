# Rollback Omnia

Omnia provides a rollback mechanism to revert an upgrade and return the cluster
to the previous version. Rollback processes components in reverse order
compared to upgrade, with manifest tracking for idempotent reruns.

!!! important

    - Rollback must be initiated from the OIM host using
      `omnia.sh --rollback` before entering the `omnia_core` container.
    - Rollback is intended for recovering from a failed or partial upgrade.
      Rolling back a fully completed upgrade is blocked by default and not
      recommended.
    - The rollback orchestrator must be invoked from the parent directory
      containing `rollback/` folders.

## When to Use Rollback

Use rollback in the following scenarios:

- An upgrade failed partway through and components are in an inconsistent
  state.
- A component upgrade completed but introduced regressions or failures.
- The upgrade was interrupted (e.g., network failure, process crash) and
  cannot be resumed.

!!! caution

    Rolling back after a fully successful upgrade is not recommended because
    all components were upgraded consistently. If you need to rollback despite
    successful completion, use `-e force_rollback=true`.

## Rollback Component Order

Rollback processes components in reverse order of the upgrade:

| Order | Component | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `slurm` | Rollback Slurm cluster (rolled back first) |
| 2 | `k8s-telemetry` | Rollback Kubernetes cluster and verify telemetry pods (single combined component) |
| 3 | `build_stream` | Rollback BuildStreaM upgrade / enablement |
| 4 | `oim` | Rollback OIM (includes OpenCHAMI) — rolled back last |

!!! note

    - Kubernetes and Telemetry are handled as a single combined rollback
      component (`k8s-telemetry`). The etcd snapshot restore reverts the K8s
      cluster to its pre-upgrade state, which also restores all telemetry pods
      (VictoriaMetrics, Kafka, etc.) to their 2.1 versions. Telemetry pod
      health verification is performed as part of the K8s rollback (Stage 8d).
      There is no separate telemetry rollback step.
    - There is no separate `local_repo`, `build_image`, or `provision`
      rollback step. The packages and images produced during upgrade do not
      require active reversion, and the Cloud-Init and BSS boot configuration
      is restored to the previous version within the Slurm and Kubernetes
      rollbacks for the affected nodes.

## Phase 0: Run Rollback Playbook (Inside Core Container)

The rollback begins inside the `omnia_core` container.

1. SSH into the `omnia_core` container:

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    ssh omnia_core
    ```

2. Run the rollback playbook:

    ```bash title="Run on: omnia_core container"
    cd /omnia/rollback
    ansible-playbook rollback.yml -e force_rollback=true
    ```

The rollback orchestrator performs the following validation checks before
making any changes:

1. **Upgrade lock check** — If
   `/opt/omnia/.data/upgrade_in_progress.lock` exists, the rollback aborts. An
   upgrade must complete (or the lock must be manually removed) before rollback
   can proceed.
2. **Completed upgrade check** — If the `upgrade_manifest.yml` shows
   `upgrade_status: completed`, the rollback is blocked by default. Override
   with `-e force_rollback=true`.
3. **Already-completed rollback check** — If a previous
   `rollback_manifest.yml` shows `rollback_status: completed`, the rollback is
   blocked. Override with `-e force_rollback=true`.

## Phase 1: Core Container Rollback (OIM Host)

After the rollback playbook completes, exit the core container and perform the core container rollback on the OIM host.

!!! important

    **Use the Omnia 2.2.0.0 `omnia.sh` script for rollback operations.**
    The `omnia.sh` script from Omnia 2.1.0.0 does not support correct rollback
    operations. You must download and use the Omnia 2.2.0.0 version of
    `omnia.sh` to perform rollbacks. Do not attempt to run
    `./omnia.sh --rollback` using the 2.1.0.0 script.

1. Exit the `omnia_core` container:

    ```bash title="Run on: omnia_core container"
    exit
    ```

2. Download the Omnia 2.2.0.0 `omnia.sh` script from the Omnia repository:

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dell/omnia/refs/tags/v2.2.0.0/omnia.sh
    ```

3. Set executable permissions:

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    chmod +x omnia.sh
    ```

4. Verify the script version (optional):

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    ./omnia.sh --version
    ```

5. Run the core container rollback command:

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    sudo ./omnia.sh --rollback
    ```

6. The script performs the following:

    - Detects current version from `oim_metadata.yml`
    - Shows available rollback targets
    - Validates version and backup availability
    - Requests user approval
    - Stops the current `omnia_core` container and swaps it to the previous
      version image
    - Restores input files, configuration, and metadata from the backup
      directory
    - Creates rollback guard lock at
      `/opt/omnia/.data/rollback_in_progress.lock`
    - Displays post-rollback instructions

The rollback orchestrator performs the following validation checks before
making any changes:

1. **Upgrade lock check** — If
   `/opt/omnia/.data/upgrade_in_progress.lock` exists, the rollback aborts. An
   upgrade must complete (or the lock must be manually removed) before rollback
   can proceed.
2. **Completed upgrade check** — If the `upgrade_manifest.yml` shows
   `upgrade_status: completed`, the rollback is blocked by default. Override
   with `-e force_rollback=true`.
3. **Already-completed rollback check** — If a previous
   `rollback_manifest.yml` shows `rollback_status: completed`, the rollback is
   blocked. Override with `-e force_rollback=true`.

### Lock Management

Lock files used during rollback:

- `/opt/omnia/.data/rollback_in_progress.lock` — Created at the start of the
  rollback. Removed on completion.
- `/opt/omnia/.data/upgrade_in_progress.lock` — If this lock exists, rollback
  aborts.

!!! note

    The `omnia.sh --rollback` wrapper may pre-create the rollback lock. The
    playbook detects this and proceeds normally.

### Manifest Tracking

Rollback state is tracked in `/opt/omnia/.data/rollback_manifest.yml`:

- `rollback_id` — Unique identifier for this rollback run.
- `triggered_from_upgrade_id` — The upgrade ID that triggered this rollback.
- `source_version` — The currently installed version (rolling back from).
- `target_version` — The version being rolled back to.
- `rollback_status` — Overall status: `in-progress` or `completed`.
- `component_status` — Per-component status: `pending`, `in-progress`,
  `completed`, `skipped`, or `failed`.

On rerun, already-completed components are automatically skipped.

### BuildStreaM Rollback

If BuildStreaM was enabled during the upgrade, the downstream components
(`slurm`, `k8s-telemetry`) were never upgraded by Omnia — they are managed by
the GitLab CI/CD pipeline. In this scenario, these components are
automatically skipped during rollback because there is nothing to roll back.
Only `build_stream` and `oim` are actually rolled back.

!!! note

    For enabling iDRAC telemetry after a BuildStreaM rollback, run the telemetry playbook manually:
    `ansible-playbook telemetry/telemetry.yml`.

Components that are skipped are recorded as `skipped` in the rollback
manifest, which is treated as a successful terminal state when the overall
rollback status is determined.

### BuildStreaM Terminal Gate (Rollback)

The BuildStreaM rollback path is automatically determined from metadata stored
during the upgrade:

**Restore Path (BuildStreaM was enabled in 2.1)**

1. Validates backup files (quadlets, database dump) exist in the backup
   directory.
2. Runs Alembic database migration downgrade (from 2.2 schema back to 2.1
   schema) while the 2.2 container is still running.
3. Stops BuildStreaM and PostgreSQL services.
4. Restores 2.1 quadlets, configuration files, and source directories from
   backup.
5. Restarts services in dependency order (PostgreSQL first, then BuildStreaM).
6. Reverts the GitLab upgrade commit via API and restores GitLab configuration
   (`gitlab.rb`, `gitlab-secrets.json`) from backup.
7. Validates BuildStreaM API health, PostgreSQL connectivity, and GitLab
   readiness.

!!! note

    If the Alembic database migration downgrade appears to hang, see
    [BuildStreaM rollback hangs during Alembic database migration](../Troubleshooting/upgrade_rollback.md)
    in the Upgrade and Rollback Troubleshooting guide.

**Uninstall Path (BuildStreaM was newly enabled during upgrade)**

1. Stops and removes BuildStreaM and PostgreSQL containers and quadlets.
2. Removes all BuildStreaM NFS directories, watcher service, and automation
   framework.
3. Uninstalls GitLab packages and removes configuration directories from the
   GitLab host.
4. Sets `enable_build_stream: false` in `build_stream_config.yml`.
5. Validates that containers, quadlets, and GitLab packages are fully removed.

!!! note

    If BuildStreaM was never upgraded (upgrade metadata file does not exist),
    the component is automatically marked as `skipped`.

!!! note

    GitLab project rollback depends on the upgrade commit being the latest
    commit. If additional commits exist after the upgrade, automatic rollback
    will not revert GitLab content. Ensure that manual GitLab commit revert to
    the previous configuration files is performed.

## Kubernetes and Telemetry Rollback

Kubernetes and Telemetry are rolled back as a single combined component. The
etcd snapshot restore reverts the entire K8s cluster state including telemetry
pods.

Rollback stages:

1. **Preflight checks** — Validates backups exist (etcd snapshot, K8s configs,
   etcd members), target rollback version packages are available in Pulp, and
   SSH connectivity to control plane nodes.
2. **Stop the cluster** — Cordons nodes and stops kubelet in correct order.
3. **Clean up stale MetalLB IPs** — Removes stale MetalLB IP assignments on
   all nodes.
4. **Restore etcd snapshot** — Restores the pre-upgrade etcd snapshot on all
   control plane nodes.
5. **Restore K8s configs** — Restores `/etc/kubernetes/` configs on all
   control plane nodes from backup.
6. **Remove kubelet feature gates** — Removes kubelet feature gates for
   compatibility with older versions.
7. **Update kubelet config parameters** — Updates kubelet `config.yaml`
   parameters to match cloud-init settings.
8. **Downgrade control plane packages** — Downgrades `kubeadm`, `kubelet`,
   and `kubectl` to the previous version and starts kubelet.
9. **Fix kube-vip split-brain** — Resolves VIP ownership after control plane
   restore.
10. **Downgrade worker packages** — Downgrades packages on workers and starts
    kubelet.
11. **Post-validation** — Validates node readiness (`kubectl get nodes`) and
    pod health.
12. **Restart network pods** — Clears stale BIRD/speaker processes.
13. **Restore Helm binary** — Restores the Helm binary to the rollback
    version.
14. **Clean up stale CSI VolumeAttachments** — Removes orphaned
    PowerScale/Isilon VolumeAttachments.
15. **Verify telemetry rollback** — Validates that all 2.1 telemetry pods
    (VictoriaMetrics, Kafka, iDRAC, LDMS, etc.) are healthy and that 2.2-only
    components (`vector-ldms`, `vector-ome`, `victoria-logs`,
    `victoria-metrics-operator`) have been removed by the etcd restore.
16. **Restore BSS boot params and cloud-init** — Restores pre-upgrade
    BSS/cloud-init configs from backup so nodes boot with the correct (old)
    images on next reboot.

!!! warning

    K8s node reboots will cause temporary cluster unavailability. Plan the
    rollback during a maintenance window.

## Slurm Rollback

The Slurm rollback workflow restores the Slurm cluster configuration to the
previously backed-up Omnia 2.1 state. During rollback, Omnia restores the
cloud-init and Bare System Setup (BSS) configurations from the upgrade backup
and applies the restored configuration by rebooting all Slurm and login nodes.

Rollback is intended primarily for recovery from a failed or partially
completed upgrade. It restores the node provisioning and configuration state
captured before the upgrade and validates the operational health of the Slurm
cluster after recovery.

!!! warning

    - All Slurm control, compute, and login nodes are rebooted simultaneously
      during rollback. Ensure that no critical workloads or user sessions are
      active before starting the rollback process.
    - Existing Omnia 2.1 NFS mount configurations are preserved during
      rollback.
    - VAST mounts added after the upgrade are not restored during rollback.
      Any new mounts configured after the upgrade must be recreated manually
      after rollback, if required.
    - Rollback restores the configuration state captured during the backup
      process. Configuration changes made after the upgrade may be lost.

**Rollback Workflow**

During rollback, Omnia performs the following operations:

1. Reads the backed-up `software_config.json` file to identify the Slurm
   deployment configuration that existed before the upgrade.
2. Reads the backed-up PXE mapping file to determine the Slurm and login
   nodes that must participate in the rollback process.
3. Restores cloud-init configurations from the Omnia 2.1 backup.
4. Restores BSS configurations from the Omnia 2.1 backup.
5. Applies the restored configuration to the following functional groups:
    - `slurm_control_node`
    - `slurm_node`
    - `login_node`
    - `login_compiler_node`
6. Initiates a coordinated reboot of all affected nodes.
7. Waits for nodes to return online after reboot.
8. Validates the operational status of Slurm services.
9. Generates a rollback status report summarizing the outcome for each node.

**Configuration Restoration**

The rollback process restores the pre-upgrade configuration captured during
the upgrade backup phase. The following configuration components are restored:

- Cloud-init configuration files.
- BSS configuration files.
- Slurm node role assignments.
- Node provisioning configuration.
- PXE-based node mapping information used by Omnia.

This restoration ensures that the Slurm infrastructure returns to the same
configuration state that existed before the upgrade was initiated.

**Node Restart and Recovery Validation**

After the backup configuration has been restored, Omnia performs a
cluster-wide reboot to activate the recovered settings.

The reboot and validation workflow includes the following steps:

- A reboot command is issued to all Slurm and login nodes.
- Each node is allowed up to 1200 seconds to complete the reboot process.
- Omnia continuously monitors node availability after the reboot.
- SSH connectivity is verified for every node.
- Each node is allowed up to 60 seconds to restore SSH connectivity after
  boot completion.
- Once SSH connectivity is confirmed, Omnia validates Slurm functionality
  using the `sinfo` command.
- Validation checks are retried automatically to account for service startup
  delays.

**Health Checks Performed**

The following checks are executed during rollback validation:

**Pre-Reboot Checks**

- Verify that the node is reachable.
- Confirm SSH accessibility before initiating the reboot.

**Post-Reboot Checks**

- Verify successful reboot completion.
- Confirm restoration of SSH connectivity.
- Validate Slurm daemon availability.
- Verify successful execution of `sinfo`.
- Confirm that the node can participate in normal cluster operations.

**Rollback Status Report**

At the end of the rollback process, Omnia generates a node-level status report
showing the outcome for every Slurm and login node. Nodes are grouped into the
following categories:

- **Successful** — The node successfully completed all rollback operations.
- **Unreachable** — The node was not reachable before the reboot phase.
- **Reboot Failed** — The reboot command failed.
- **SSH Failure** — The node rebooted but did not restore SSH connectivity
  within the allowed timeout period.
- **sinfo Failure** — Slurm services failed to start correctly or did not
  respond to `sinfo` validation checks.

**Post-Rollback Recommendations**

After rollback completes successfully:

- Verify cluster health using `sinfo` and `scontrol show nodes`.
- Confirm that all expected compute nodes are visible and in the appropriate
  state.
- Validate connectivity and accessibility of all required NFS mounts.
- Review any custom storage mounts that were added after the upgrade and
  recreate them if necessary.
- Run a small test workload to verify scheduler functionality.
- Review the rollback status report and investigate any nodes reported under
  the Unreachable, Reboot Failed, SSH Failure, or sinfo Failure categories
  before returning the cluster to production use.

## Post-Rollback

After rollback completes:

1. The `upgrade_manifest.yml` is archived to `/opt/omnia/.data/archive/` so
   the next upgrade starts with a fresh manifest.
2. **Kubernetes artifacts archival** — If the `k8s-telemetry` rollback
   completed successfully, all upgrade and rollback artifacts are automatically
   archived to a timestamped directory on the NFS share
   (`<nfs_mount>/upgrade/archive/<rollback_id>_<timestamp>/`). This includes:
    - `upgrade_status.yml` — Per-node upgrade step tracking
    - `rollback_status.yml` — Per-node rollback step tracking
    - `backup/` — etcd snapshot, K8s configs, and addon backups
    - `telemetry/` — Telemetry backups
    - `logs/` — Upgrade and rollback execution logs from the OIM container

    The archival process also cleans up:

    - Lock files on NFS (`upgrade.lock`, `rollback.lock`)
    - `omnia-upgrade.repo` from all K8s nodes

    This ensures a clean slate for the next upgrade run while preserving all
    evidence for root cause analysis.
3. The rollback summary displays the final component statuses.

## Post-Rollback Verification

After the rollback completes, verify the following:

1. Check the rollback summary displayed at the end of the playbook run.
2. Verify the rollback manifest:

    ```bash title="Run on: omnia_core container"
    cat /opt/omnia/.data/rollback_manifest.yml
    ```

3. Confirm all component statuses show `completed` or `skipped`.
4. Validate cluster health:
    - **Kubernetes cluster**: `kubectl get nodes`
    - **Slurm cluster**: `sinfo`
    - **Telemetry**: Verify metrics are flowing
5. Confirm the `upgrade_manifest.yml` has been archived:

    ```bash title="Run on: omnia_core container"
    ls /opt/omnia/.data/archive/
    ```
