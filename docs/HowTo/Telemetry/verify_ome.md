# Verify OpenManage Enterprise Telemetry (OME)

## Overview

This page provides verification steps for the OME telemetry data flow from Kafka to VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs.

## Prerequisites


- The [Configure OpenManage Enterprise Telemetry (OME)](telemetry_from_ome.md) procedure is complete.
- The Vector-OME bridge is enabled in `telemetry_config.yml` for metrics and/or logs routing.
- Nodes must be discovered in OpenManage Enterprise before configuring telemetry streaming.


## Verify OME Messages in Kafka

To verify that OME telemetry data is being successfully published to the OME Kafka topics:

1. Log in to the Service Kubernetes control plane.

2. Set the required variables:

    ```bash title="Run on K8s control plane"
    KAFKA_LB_IP=<external IP of bridge-bridge-lb service>
    TOPIC=<OME Topic Name>
    GROUP=ome-consumer-group
    INSTANCE=ome-consumer
    ```

3. Create a Kafka consumer:

    ```bash title="Run on K8s control plane"
    curl -s -X POST "http://$KAFKA_LB_IP:8080/consumers/$GROUP" \
      -H 'content-type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json' \
      -d '{"name": "ome-consumer", "format": "json", "auto.offset.reset": "earliest"}'
    ```

4. View the list of OME Kafka topics configured:

    ```bash title="Run on K8s control plane"
    curl -s -X GET "http://$KAFKA_LB_IP:8080/topics" | jq '.'
    ```

5. Subscribe the consumer to the telemetry topic:

    ```bash title="Run on K8s control plane"
    curl -s -X POST "http://$KAFKA_LB_IP:8080/consumers/$GROUP/instances/$INSTANCE/subscription" \
      -H 'content-type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json' \
      -d '{"topics": ["'"$TOPIC"'"]}'
    ```

6. Consume messages from the topic:

    ```bash title="Run on K8s control plane"
    while true; do
      curl -s -X GET "http://$KAFKA_LB_IP:8080/consumers/$GROUP/instances/$INSTANCE/records" \
        -H 'accept: application/vnd.kafka.json.v2+json' | jq '.'
      sleep 2
    done
    ```

7. (Optional) Cleanup the consumer:

    ```bash title="Run on K8s control plane"
    curl -s -X DELETE "http://$KAFKA_LB_IP:8080/consumers/$GROUP/instances/$INSTANCE"
    ```

!!! note

    - **From beginning**: Ensure `"auto.offset.reset": "earliest"` when creating the consumer if you want existing data.
    - **Message format**: Use `"format": "json"` only if producers publish JSON. Otherwise use `"binary"` and decode base64 payloads.
    - **Throughput**: Adjust polling interval; bridge returns empty array when no new records.
    - **404/409 errors**: 404 usually means wrong group/instance name; 409 means already subscribed.

## View OME Metrics in VictoriaMetrics UI (VMUI)

To verify that OME telemetry data is being successfully routed from Kafka to VictoriaMetrics using Vector:

1. Access the VMUI in a web browser:

    ```
    https://<external vmselect loadbalancer IP>:8481/select/0/vmui
    ```

2. Navigate to the **Explore** tab.

3. Run the following query to retrieve health metrics from OME:

    ```
    last_over_time({source_subsystem="ome", type="health"}[24h])
    ```

    ![OME Metrics in VMUI](../../assets/images/external_kafka_ome_metrics_health.png)

!!! note

    `source_subsystem=ome` comes from the `ome_identifier` that the user has given in the `telemetry_config.yml` input file and the suffix after the dot (i.e., health, inventory, auditlogs) is coming from OME.

4. Verify that OME-related metrics are displayed in the results.

!!! note

    Ensure that the Vector-OME bridge is enabled in `telemetry_config.yml` (`telemetry_bridges > vector_ome > metrics_enabled: true`) for metrics data to flow from Kafka to VictoriaMetrics.

## View OME Logs in VictoriaLogs

To verify that OME telemetry data is being successfully routed from Kafka to VictoriaLogs using Vector:

1. Access the VictoriaLogs UI in a web browser:

    ```
    https://<external vlselect loadbalancer IP>:9471/select/vmui
    ```

2. Navigate to the **Select** tab.

3. In the query field, run the following query to filter for OME logs:

    ```
    _msg_topic:ome.auditlogs
    ```

    ![OME Logs in VictoriaLogs](../../assets/images/external_kafka_ome_logs_audit.png)

4. Verify that OME-related logs are displayed in the results.

!!! note

    Ensure that the Vector-OME bridge is enabled in `telemetry_config.yml` (`telemetry_bridges > vector_ome > logs_enabled: true`) for logs data to flow from Kafka to VictoriaLogs.
