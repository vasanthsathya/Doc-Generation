# Perform Cleanup Operations

## Overview

Build Stream supports a maximum of 50 build images. When the build image count exceeds this limit, you must manually perform cleanup operations to remove old images before creating new ones.

!!! warning

    Do not cancel a running GitLab pipeline or stage. Cancellation prevents some pipeline steps from executing, which leaves the Build Stream job in an intermediate, inconsistent state.

## Prerequisites

- Administrative access to the OIM
- Build Stream API server is running
- PostgreSQL database is accessible

## Procedure

1. Navigate to the GitLab project URL:

    ```text title="GitLab project URL"
    https://<gitlab_host>:<gitlab_https_port>/root/<gitlab_project_name>
    ```

2. Navigate to **Build** → **Pipelines**.

3. Click **New Pipeline**.

4. In the **Run new pipeline** dialog box, enter the variable name as **PIPELINE_TYPE** and enter the value as **cleanup**.

5. Click **Run Pipeline** to execute the cleanup pipeline.

6. In the pipeline, select the image to be cleaned up from the `select_image` stage.

7. Click the **Play** button on the cleanup stage to execute the cleanup.

8. Monitor the pipeline progress through the GitLab web interface:

    - Click on the running pipeline to view details.
    - Monitor the cleanup stage as it progresses to completion.

9. Review the stage status indicators:

    - **Green checkmark**: Stage completed successfully
    - **Red X**: Stage failed (click for error details)
    - **Blue circle**: Stage currently running

## Verification

1. Check the GitLab pipeline status to ensure the cleanup stage passed.

2. Verify the Image Group count is within the configured retention limit.

3. Review the cleanup pipeline logs in GitLab for specific details about which Image Groups were removed.

- [Execute Build Pipeline](execute_build_pipeline.md) -- Create new images after cleanup

## Troubleshooting

- **Cleanup pipeline failing**: Verify that the Build Stream API server and PostgreSQL database are running. See [Build Stream Troubleshooting](../../Troubleshooting/build_stream.md).
