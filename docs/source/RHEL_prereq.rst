Omnia Deployment Requirements
=============================

This section outlines the key requirements for the components used by Omnia to deploy HPC clusters. For more information about the supported devices and software, see :doc:`Support Matrix <Overview/SupportMatrix/index>`.


NFS Server
-----------

* Choose an NFS server located outside your cluster.
* The NFS share has **755 permissions** and ``no_root_squash`` is enabled during mount.
* To enable ``no_root_squash``, edit the ``/etc/exports`` file on the NFS server and include the option for the exported path, run the following command:

  .. code-block:: bash

     /<your_exported_path>  *(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)

* Ensure that the external NFS share is accessible from all nodes (both diskless and diskful)
  and is reachable via the admin network.

NFS Server for K8s
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Minimum NFS k8s is 200 GB. The storage is recommended based on small cluster deployments. Increase the storage based on cluster size and telemetry data.
* Ensure that there is a dedicated mount point for each NFS.

NFS Server for Slurm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Minimum NFS Slurm is 50 GB. Increase the storage based on job data.
* Ensure that there is a dedicated mount point for each NFS.

NFS Server for Omnia Infrastructure Manager (OIM)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Omnia recommends using an NFS share with at least 100 GB storage for OIM and cluster configuration.
* Ensure that there is a dedicated mount point for each NFS.

Omnia Infrastructure Manager (OIM)
----------------------------------

* Choose a **server outside of your intended cluster** that meets the required :doc:`Storage Requirements <OmniaInstallGuide/RHEL_new/RHELSpace>` to function as the Omnia Infrastructure Manager (OIM).
* Ensure that the OIM has the RHEL operating system installed with the **Server with GUI** Base Environment. For a complete list of supported RHEL versions, see the :doc:`supported operating systems <Overview/SupportMatrix/OperatingSystems/index>`.
* Ensure that **Podman** container engine is installed on the OIM.
* The OIM must have **two active Network Interface Cards (NICs)**:
   * One connected to the **public network** (for downloading and storing packages and images).
   * One dedicated to **internal cluster communication**.
* Ensure that the OIM has **internet access**.
* Verify that **Git** is installed. If not, install it using:

     .. code-block:: bash

        dnf install git -y

* All target bare-metal servers (cluster nodes) must be **reachable from the OIM**.
* Make sure that the required ports are open on the OIM node for cluster deployment. For detailed information on the required ports, refer to the :doc:`Omnia Ports <omnia_ports>`.
* The ``omnia_core`` and ``omnia_auth`` container images are deployed on the OIM. For instructions to deploy containers, see :doc:`Deploy Omnia Core Container <OmniaInstallGuide/RHEL_new/omnia_startup>`.
  
Repository
-----------

* Enable the **AppStream** and **BaseOS** repositories via the RHEL subscription manager.
* Ensure that RHEL has an **active subscription** or is configured to access **local repositories**.
* Verify that all **repository URLs** for the software packages are **accessible** — downloads will fail for inaccessible packages.
* For RHEL systems without a subscription, the repository URLs for ``x86_64_codeready-builder``, ``x86_64_appstream``, and ``x86_64_baseos`` are mandatory.
* Docker credentials are a mandatory requirement to pull in the essential packages during local repository deployment. 
* If the Slurm RPMS is already available, update the server using the following command: ::
        
    /opt/omnia/input/project_default/local_repo_config.yml
  
  Repository is hosted, use the URL created in  ``local_repo_config.yml`` file.

   - { url: "<hosted slurm repository url>", gpgkey: "", sslcacert: "", sslclientkey: "", sslclientcert: "",  name: "x86_64_slurm_custom" }

   Run ``ansible-playbook local_repo/local_repo.yml``.
* Create Slurm repository build for x86_64. See `Build Slurm repository for x86_64 <OmniaInstallGuide/RHEL_new/OmniaCluster/BuildingCluster/build_slurm_repo.html>`_ and `Host RPMS on Apache server <OmniaInstallGuide/RHEL_new/OmniaCluster/BuildingCluster/hosting_RPMS_on_Apache_server.html>`_.



Service Kubernetes Cluster 
---------------------------

* A minimum of **three Kubernetes controller nodes** must be available.

iDRAC Telemetry Metric Collection 
----------------------------------

* **Redfish** is enabled in iDRAC.
* **iDRAC firmware** is updated to the latest version.
* A **Datacenter license** is installed on all iDRAC interfaces.
* **Correct node service tags** are displayed on the iDRAC interface.
* For telemetry collection on the service cluster, ensure all **BMC (iDRAC) IPs** are **reachable** from the service cluster nodes.

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
--------------------------------------------

* The LDAP server details are required to configure the ``omnia_auth`` container and OpenLDAP as a proxy server. See :doc:`Configure OpenLDAP as a proxy server <OmniaInstallGuide/RHEL_new/Authentication/OpenLDAP>`.

Lightweight Distributed Metric Service (LDMS)
---------------------------------------------

* The LDMS RPM must be available in the user repository, and the ``ldms.json`` file should be updated accordingly. 
  If the LDMS RPM is not available, refer to  `Building LDMS PRODUCER RPM Package <https://github.com/dell/omnia-artifactory?tab=readme-ov-file#building-ldms-producer-rpm-package>`_ for instructions on building LDMS RPMs. 

Slurm
------
* The Slurm RPM must be available in the user repository. If the Slurm RPM is not available, refer to `Slurm Quick Start Administrator Guide <https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart_admin.html>`_ for instructions on building Slurm RPMs.
* If the Slurm RPMS is already available, update the server using the following command: ::
        
    /opt/omnia/input/project_default/local_repo_config.yml
  
  Repository is hosted, use the URL created in  ``local_repo_config.yml`` file.

   - { url: "<hosted slurm repository url>", gpgkey: "", sslcacert: "", sslclientkey: "", sslclientcert: "",  name: "x86_64_slurm_custom" }

   Run ``ansible-playbook local_repo/local_repo.yml``.
* Create Slurm repository build for x86_64. See `Build Slurm repository for x86_64 <OmniaInstallGuide/RHEL_new/OmniaCluster/BuildingCluster/build_slurm_repo.html>`_ and `Host RPMS on Apache server <OmniaInstallGuide/RHEL_new/OmniaCluster/BuildingCluster/hosting_RPMS_on_Apache_server.html>`_.
