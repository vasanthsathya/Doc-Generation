Discover Nodes
==============


Run the Omnia discovery playbook to PXE-boot and register bare-metal servers
using the mapping file. Discovery identifies each server, assigns its network
configuration, and prepares it for OS provisioning.


Overview
--------


The ``discovery.yml`` playbook automates the following process:

#. Reads the ``pxe_mapping_file.csv`` to identify target servers.
#. Configures iDRAC/BMC settings on each server using Redfish APIs.
#. Sets PXE boot as the first boot device.
#. Powers on each server to trigger PXE boot.
#. The server boots from the OIM's DHCP/TFTP services and registers with
   OpenCHAMI's State Manager Daemon (SMD).
#. SMD records the server's hardware inventory, MAC addresses, and assigned
   IP addresses.



Prerequisites
-------------


- The :doc:`Prepare Oim <prepare_oim>` procedure is complete (OpenCHAMI and DHCP are
  running).
- The :doc:`Build Cluster Images <build_cluster_images>` procedure is complete (boot images are in
  MinIO).
- The :doc:`Create Mapping File <create_mapping_file>` procedure is complete.
- The :doc:`Configure Credentials <configure_credentials>` procedure is complete (BMC credentials
  configured).
- BMC/iDRAC interfaces on target servers are connected to the BMC network and
  have IP addresses assigned (either static or via existing DHCP).
- Admin network NICs on target servers are cabled and connected to the admin
  network switch.



Procedure
---------


1. Enter the omnia_core container:

   .. code-block:: bash
      :caption: Run on: OIM host

      ssh omnia_core



2. Verify the mapping file is in place:

   .. code-block:: bash
      :caption: Run on: omnia_core container

      cat /opt/omnia/input/project_default/pxe_mapping_file.csv



3. Run the discovery playbook:

   .. code-block:: bash
      :caption: Run on: omnia_core container

      cd /omnia/discovery
      ansible-playbook discovery.yml --ask-vault-pass



   The playbook will:

   - Connect to each server's BMC/iDRAC using Redfish.
   - Configure network boot settings.
   - Set PXE as the first boot device.
   - Power-cycle the servers.
   - Wait for each server to PXE boot and register with SMD.


   .. note::

      Discovery can take **30-60 minutes** depending on the number of nodes.
      Each server must complete a full PXE boot cycle.

4. Monitor discovery progress by watching the Ansible output. Each node
   will progress through these stages:

   - ``Configuring BMC`` -- Setting iDRAC boot options
   - ``Powering on`` -- Sending power-on command via Redfish
   - ``Waiting for PXE boot`` -- Node is booting from network
   - ``Registered`` -- Node appeared in SMD inventory






Verification
------------


1. List discovered nodes in OpenCHAMI:

   .. code-block:: bash
      :caption: Run on: omnia_core container

      ochami node list



   Expected output shows all nodes from the mapping file with their service
   tags, MAC addresses, and assigned IPs.

2. Check SMD inventory:

   .. code-block:: bash
      :caption: Run on: omnia_core container

      ochami smd status



3. Verify node count matches the mapping file:

   .. code-block:: bash
      :caption: Run on: omnia_core container

      # Count discovered nodes
      ochami node list | wc -l

      # Count entries in mapping file (excluding header)
      tail -n +2 /opt/omnia/input/project_default/pxe_mapping_file.csv | wc -l



4. Ping each discovered node on the admin network:

   .. code-block:: bash
      :caption: Run on: omnia_core container

      # Example: ping a specific node
      ping -c 3 10.5.0.101



5. Check Ansible inventory was populated:

   .. code-block:: bash
      :caption: Run on: omnia_core container

      ansible-inventory --list | python3 -m json.tool | head -50





Next Steps
----------


- :doc:`Pxe Boot Nodes <pxe_boot_nodes>` -- Ensure all nodes complete provisioning.
- :doc:`Verify Cluster <verify_cluster>` -- Verify the cluster is operational.
- :doc:`Setup Slurm <../Slurm/setup_slurm>` -- Deploy Slurm on discovered nodes.






Troubleshooting
---------------


**Node not discovered (missing from SMD)**

- Verify the BMC IP is reachable from the OIM:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :caption: Run on: OIM host

     ping -c 3 <bmc-ip>


- Check iDRAC web UI for boot errors.
- Verify the ``ADMIN_MAC`` in the mapping file matches the PXE NIC.



**BMC connection refused**

- Confirm BMC credentials are correct in the encrypted credentials file.
- Verify iDRAC is not locked out (too many failed login attempts).
- Check that Redfish is enabled in iDRAC settings.


**PXE boot timeout**

- Verify DHCP is running on the OIM:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :caption: Run on: OIM host

     systemctl status coredhcp.service


- Check TFTP service:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :caption: Run on: OIM host

     systemctl status tftpd.service


- Verify the admin network switch is configured with the correct VLAN.


**Some nodes discover but others do not**

- Check for MAC address typos in the mapping file.
- Verify the physical cabling on failed nodes.
- Check for IP conflicts on the admin network:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :caption: Run on: OIM host

     arping -D -I <admin-nic> <admin-ip>



**Discovery playbook fails at BMC configuration step**

- Ensure iDRAC firmware is up to date (minimum 5.x for PowerEdge 15th gen).
- Verify Redfish API is accessible:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :caption: Run on: OIM host

     curl -sk https://<bmc-ip>/redfish/v1/ -u <user>:<pass>
