How-to Guides
=============


Task-oriented procedures for deploying, configuring, and managing Omnia
clusters. Each guide follows a consistent structure: **Overview**, **Prerequisites**,
**Procedure**, **Verification**, **Next Steps**, and **Troubleshooting**.


.. tip::


   If you are new to Omnia, start with the :doc:`Index <../GetStarted/index>` tutorials
   first. How-to guides assume you understand Omnia's architecture and have a
   working OIM.



Initial Setup & Provisioning
----------------------------


Get Omnia installed on your OIM and provision bare-metal servers into a
working cluster.


Slurm Job Scheduling
--------------------


Deploy and manage Slurm-based HPC clusters, including GPU-accelerated
workloads and dynamic node management.


Kubernetes Services
-------------------


Deploy and configure the Kubernetes service cluster used for platform
services, monitoring, and storage.


Storage
-------


Configure shared storage for your cluster, including NFS and PowerVault
block storage.


Networking
----------


Set up high-performance interconnects for your compute fabric, including
InfiniBand and RoCE.


Authentication
--------------


Configure centralized user authentication across your cluster using LDAP.


Telemetry & Monitoring
----------------------


Deploy and configure the telemetry pipeline for cluster-wide metrics
collection, aggregation, and visualization.


Containers & Packages
---------------------


Run containerized workloads and deploy additional software packages on
provisioned nodes.


BuildStreaM (CI/CD)
-------------------


Automate cluster deployment using GitLab CI/CD pipelines and the
BuildStreaM catalog-driven workflow.
