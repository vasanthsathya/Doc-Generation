Omnia is an open-source, Ansible-based toolkit by Dell Technologies that
automates the deployment and management of HPC, AI, and data analytics clusters
on Dell PowerEdge servers. From bare-metal provisioning to job scheduling,
telemetry, and storage configuration, Omnia turns a rack of servers into a
production-ready cluster.

The project is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/dell/omnia>`_, where you can:

- Access the source code
- Report issues
- Ask questions
- Contribute to development
