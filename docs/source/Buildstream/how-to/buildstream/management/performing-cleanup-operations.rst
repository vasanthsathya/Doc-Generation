Perform Cleanup Operations
============================

BuildStream supports a maximum of 50 build images. When the build image count exceeds this limit, you must manually perform cleanup operations to remove old images before creating new ones.

Prerequisites
------------

Before performing cleanup operations, ensure the following:

* You have administrative access to the OIM
* BuildStream API server is running
* PostgreSQL database is accessible

Procedure
---------

#. Navigate to the GitLab project URL::

    https://<gitlab_host>:<gitlab_https_port>/root/<gitlab_project_name>

#. Navigate to **Build** → **Pipelines**.

#. Click **New Pipeline**.

#.  In the **Run new pipeline** dialog box, enter the variable name as **PIPELINE_TYPE** and enter the value as **cleanup**.

#. Click **Run Pipeline** to execute the cleanup pipeline.

#. Monitor the pipeline progress through the GitLab web interface:

   a. Click on the running pipeline to view details.
   
   b. Monitor the cleanup stage as it progresses to completion.
 
#. Review the stage status indicators:
    - |success| **Green checkmark**: Stage completed successfully
    - |failed| **Red X**: Stage failed (click for error details)
    - |running| **Blue circle**: Stage currently running

.. |success| image:: ../../../../images/Icons/green_check.png
.. |failed| image:: ../../../../images/Icons/red_x.png
.. |running| image:: ../../../../images/Icons/blue_circle.png

Verification
------------

#. Check the GitLab pipeline status to ensure the cleanup stage passed.

#. Verify the Image Group count is within the configured retention limit.

#. Review the cleanup pipeline logs in GitLab for specific details about which Image Groups were removed.
