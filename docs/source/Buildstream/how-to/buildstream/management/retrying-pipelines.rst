Retry Pipeline Operations
==========================

You can retry the pipeline if there are failures in the stages. Before retrying, identify and resolve the issue that caused the failure.

Prerequisites
------------

Before retrying pipeline operations, ensure the following:

* A Job exists with one or more stages in `FAILED` state
* The issue that caused the failure has been identified and resolved
* Configuration files (PXE mapping and input files) have been corrected if needed

Procedure
---------

#.  Navigate to **Build** → **Pipelines** and identify the failed pipeline. 

#. Identify the stage that failed and review the error logs.

#. Resolve the issue that caused the failure:

   a. Fix configuration errors if present.
   
   b. Resolve network connectivity issues.
   
   c. Clear resource constraints if applicable.
   
   d. Address any other specific error conditions.

#. To retry the failed pipeline, click the **Retry donwstream pipline** icon on the stage that executes the entire pipeline.

 .. note::
   This creates a new job and re-executes the entire pipeline from the beginning. It is recommended to retry the entire pipeline rather than individual stage.

#. Verify that the pipeline completes successfully.

Verification
------------

#. Check the GitLab pipeline status to ensure all stages passed.

#. Verify the new Pipeline ID is created for the retry operation.

#. For build pipelines, verify that images were created successfully.

#. For deploy pipelines, verify that nodes were deployed correctly.

#. Compare results with the original failed pipeline to confirm the issue is resolved.
