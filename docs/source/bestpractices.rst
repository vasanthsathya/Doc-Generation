Best Practices
==============

* Ensure that PowerCap policy is disabled and the BIOS system profile is set to 'Performance' on the OIM.
* Always run playbooks inside the Omnia core container from the directory where they are located. Use the ``cd`` command to navigate to the playbook's directory before executing it.
* If telemetry is enabled, ensure sufficient storage is available in NFS as provided in the ``telemetry_config.yml``.
* When using PowerScale as an NFS server, integrate it using the Dell CSI PowerScale driver instead of configuring it as an external NFS server.
* Ensure that the external NFS is accessible by all the nodes intended to be booted and is reachable by admin network. 
* Avoid rebooting the OIM as much as possible to prevent disruptions to the network configuration.
* Review all the prerequisites and input files before running Omnia playbooks.
* Ensure that the Firefox version being used on the RHEL OIM is the latest available. This can be achieved using ``dnf update firefox -y``
* Run ``yum update --security`` routinely on the RHEL OIM to get the latest security updates.
