Provisioning Issues
===================


Issues related to PXE booting, node discovery, cloud-init configuration, and
the ``discovery.yml`` playbook.


PXE boot failures
-----------------



NIC not set to PXE boot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**Symptom**

The target node does not attempt a network boot. It boots directly to the
local disk or enters the BIOS setup instead of requesting a PXE image from
the OIM.

**Cause**

The node's BIOS/UEFI boot order does not include PXE/network boot, or PXE
is disabled on the NIC connected to the admin network.

**Resolution**

1. Enter the node's BIOS/UEFI setup (press F2 during POST on Dell PowerEdge
    servers).
2. Navigate to **System BIOS** > **Network Settings**.
3. Enable **PXE Boot** on the NIC connected to the admin network.
4. Navigate to **Boot Settings** > **BIOS Boot Settings** (or **UEFI Boot
    Settings**).
5. Set **Network Boot** (PXE) as the first boot option.
6. Save and exit BIOS. The node should now attempt PXE boot on the next
    restart.

Alternatively, use ``racadm`` to configure remotely:


.. code-block:: bash

       racadm set NIC.NICConfig.1.LegacyBootProto PXE
       racadm set BIOS.BiosBootSettings.BootSeq NIC.Slot.1-1




Wrong MAC address in mapping file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**Symptom**

The node PXE boots but does not receive an IP address, or it receives an IP
but is not recognized by OpenCHAMI.

**Cause**

The MAC address in ``/omnia/input/mapping_file.csv`` does not match the
actual MAC address of the NIC being used for PXE boot.

**Resolution**

#. Verify the correct MAC address from iDRAC or the node's BIOS:


.. code-block:: bash

          # From iDRAC (using racadm)
          racadm getsysinfo | grep "MAC Address"



#. Update the mapping file with the correct MAC:


.. code-block:: text

          # /omnia/input/mapping_file.csv
          AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF,compute-01,10.5.0.101



#. Re-run the discovery playbook:


.. code-block:: bash

          ssh omnia_core
          cd /omnia
          ansible-playbook playbooks/discovery.yml




DHCP not serving IP addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**Symptom**

Nodes attempt PXE boot but fail with a DHCP timeout error:


.. code-block:: text

       PXE-E51: No DHCP or proxyDHCP offers were received



**Cause**

- The CoreDHCP container on the OIM is not running.
- The DHCP range is exhausted.
- A network misconfiguration prevents DHCP broadcasts from reaching the OIM.
- Another DHCP server on the same network is interfering.

**Resolution**

1. Verify the CoreDHCP container is running:


.. code-block:: bash

          podman ps | grep coredhcp



       If it is not running, start it:


.. code-block:: bash

          podman start coredhcp



2. Check CoreDHCP logs for errors:


.. code-block:: bash

          podman logs coredhcp



3. Verify no rogue DHCP server exists on the admin network:


.. code-block:: bash

          nmap --script broadcast-dhcp-discover -e <admin_nic>



4. Ensure the OIM's admin NIC is on the correct VLAN and subnet.


TFTP timeout during PXE boot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**Symptom**

    The node receives a DHCP lease but fails to download the boot image:


.. code-block:: text

       PXE-E32: TFTP open timeout
       PXE-T02: TFTP packet timeout



**Cause**

    - The TFTP service on the OIM is not running.
    - Firewall rules on the OIM are blocking TFTP traffic (UDP port 69).
    - The TFTP root directory does not contain the expected boot files.

**Resolution**

1. Verify the TFTP container is running:


.. code-block:: bash

          podman ps | grep tftp



2. Check firewall rules:


.. code-block:: bash

          firewall-cmd --list-all | grep tftp



       If TFTP is not allowed:


.. code-block:: bash

          firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=tftp
          firewall-cmd --reload



3. Verify boot files exist in the TFTP root:


.. code-block:: bash

          ls /var/lib/tftpboot/




cloud-init issues
-----------------


**Symptom**

Nodes boot the OS successfully but post-boot configuration fails. The node
is accessible via console but network settings, hostname, or SSH keys are
not configured correctly.

**Cause**

- The cloud-init data source is not configured.
- The cloud-init configuration file has syntax errors.
- The cloud-init service was disabled or removed from the OS image.

**Resolution**

1. Check cloud-init status on the affected node:

.. code-block:: bash

   cloud-init status --long

2. Review cloud-init logs:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat /var/log/cloud-init.log
   cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log

3. Verify the data source configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/

4. If cloud-init was disabled, re-enable it:

.. code-block:: bash

   systemctl enable cloud-init
   cloud-init clean
   reboot




`discovery.yml` failures
------------------------


**Symptom**

The ``discovery.yml`` playbook fails with errors related to OpenCHAMI, BMC
connectivity, or inventory population.

**Cause**

- OpenCHAMI services (SMD, BSS) are not running on the OIM.
- BMC/iDRAC credentials are incorrect.
- The BMC network is unreachable from the OIM.

**Resolution**

1. Verify OpenCHAMI services are running:


.. code-block:: bash

          podman ps | grep ochami



2. Test BMC connectivity:


.. code-block:: bash

          # Ping the BMC IP
          ping <bmc_ip>

          # Test Redfish API access
          curl -k -u <user>:<pass> https://<bmc_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems



3. Verify BMC credentials in the configuration:


.. code-block:: bash

          ssh omnia_core
          ansible-vault view /omnia/input/credentials.yml



4. Check discovery logs for detailed errors:


.. code-block:: bash

          cat /opt/omnia/log/core/playbooks/discovery.log




Nodes not appearing after discovery
-----------------------------------


**Symptom**

After running ``discovery.yml`` successfully, the expected nodes do not
appear in ``ochami-cli smd components list`` or ``sinfo``.

**Cause**

- The node's BMC did not respond during the discovery window.
- The node's MAC address does not match any entry in the mapping file.
- The node booted but failed cloud-init, so it did not register with the
  OIM.

**Resolution**

1. Check the OpenCHAMI inventory:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh omnia_core
   ochami-cli smd components list

2. Verify the node's BMC is responsive:

.. code-block:: bash

   ping <bmc_ip>
   curl -k -u <user>:<pass> https://<bmc_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems

3. Re-run discovery for the specific node by power-cycling it via iDRAC:

.. code-block:: bash

   racadm -r <bmc_ip> -u <user> -p <pass> serveraction powercycle

4. Monitor the discovery log in real time:

.. code-block:: bash

   tail -f /opt/omnia/log/core/playbooks/discovery.log
