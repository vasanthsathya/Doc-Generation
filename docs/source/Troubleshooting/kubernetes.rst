Kubernetes Issues
=================


Issues related to the Kubernetes service cluster, including control plane
initialization, pod scheduling, networking, storage, and load balancing.


Control plane not initializing
------------------------------


???+ note "Symptom"

    The Kubernetes control plane fails to initialize. ``kubectl get nodes``
    returns a connection error, or the ``omnia.yml`` playbook fails during the
    Kubernetes deployment phase.

??? note "Cause"

    - Required ports (6443, 2379-2380, 10250-10252) are blocked by a firewall.
    - The ``kubelet`` service failed to start.
    - Insufficient resources (CPU, memory) on the control plane node.
    - A previous Kubernetes installation was not fully cleaned up.

??? note "Resolution"

    #. Check ``kubelet`` status on the control plane node:


.. code-block:: bash

          ssh <kube_control_plane> systemctl status kubelet
          ssh <kube_control_plane> journalctl -u kubelet --no-pager -n 50



    #. Verify required ports are open:


.. code-block:: bash

          ssh <kube_control_plane> ss -tlnp | grep -E '6443|2379|10250'



    #. Check for leftover state from a previous installation:


.. code-block:: bash

          ssh <kube_control_plane> ls /etc/kubernetes/manifests/



       If stale files exist, reset Kubernetes:


.. code-block:: bash

          ssh <kube_control_plane> kubeadm reset -f
          ssh <kube_control_plane> rm -rf /etc/kubernetes/ /var/lib/etcd/



    #. Re-run the Omnia Kubernetes deployment:


.. code-block:: bash

          ssh omnia_core
          cd /omnia
          ansible-playbook playbooks/omnia.yml --tags kubernetes




Pod scheduling failures
-----------------------


???+ note "Symptom"

    Pods remain in ``Pending`` state indefinitely. ``kubectl describe pod

.. raw:: html

       <pod_name>`` shows scheduling errors:
   
       ```text
       Warning  FailedScheduling  0/3 nodes are available: 3 node(s) had taint
       {node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: }, that the pod didn't tolerate.
       ```
   
   
   ??? note "Cause"
   
       - No worker nodes are available (only control plane nodes exist).
       - Worker nodes are in `NotReady` state.
       - Resource requests exceed available capacity on worker nodes.
       - Taints on nodes prevent pod scheduling.
   
   ??? note "Resolution"
   
       1. Check node status:
   
          ```bash
          kubectl get nodes
          ```
   
   
       2. If worker nodes are `NotReady`, check kubelet on those nodes:
   
          ```bash
          ssh <kube_worker> systemctl status kubelet
          ssh <kube_worker> journalctl -u kubelet --no-pager -n 50
          ```
   
   
       3. If only control plane nodes exist, either add worker nodes or allow
          scheduling on control planes (not recommended for production):
   
          ```bash
          # Add worker nodes via Omnia
          ssh omnia_core
          cd /omnia
          ansible-playbook playbooks/add_node.yml
          ```
   
   
       4. Check resource availability:
   
          ```bash
          kubectl describe nodes | grep -A 5 "Allocated resources"
          ```
   
   
       5. Remove problematic taints if appropriate:
   
          ```bash
          kubectl taint nodes <node_name> <taint_key>-
          ```
   
   
   ## MetalLB not assigning IP addresses
   
   
   ???+ note "Symptom"
   
       Services of type `LoadBalancer` remain in `<pending>` state and never
       receive an external IP:
   
       ```bash
       kubectl get svc
       # EXTERNAL-IP shows <pending>
       ```
   
   
   ??? note "Cause"
   
       - MetalLB is not deployed or its pods are not running.
       - The MetalLB IP address pool is not configured or is exhausted.
       - The MetalLB speaker pods cannot reach the network.
   
   ??? note "Resolution"
   
       1. Verify MetalLB pods are running:
   
          ```bash
          kubectl get pods -n metallb-system
          ```
   
   
       2. Check MetalLB logs:
   
          ```bash
          kubectl logs -n metallb-system -l app=metallb,component=controller
          kubectl logs -n metallb-system -l app=metallb,component=speaker
          ```
   
   
       3. Verify the IP address pool configuration:
   
          ```bash
          kubectl get ipaddresspool -n metallb-system -o yaml
          ```
   
   
          If no pool exists, create one:
   
          ```yaml
          apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
          kind: IPAddressPool
          metadata:
            name: default-pool
            namespace: metallb-system
          spec:
            addresses:
            - 10.5.1.100-10.5.1.200
          ```
   
   
       4. Verify the L2 advertisement is configured:
   
          ```bash
          kubectl get l2advertisement -n metallb-system
          ```
   
   
   ## NFS CSI mount failures
   
   
   ???+ note "Symptom"
   
       Pods that use NFS-backed persistent volumes fail to start. ``kubectl
       describe pod`` shows mount errors:
   
       ```text
       Warning  FailedMount  Unable to attach or mount volumes: timed out waiting
       for the condition
       ```
   
   
   ??? note "Cause"
   
       - The NFS server is unreachable from the Kubernetes worker nodes.
       - The NFS CSI driver pods are not running.
       - The NFS export path is incorrect in the PersistentVolume definition.
       - Firewall rules block NFS traffic (ports 2049, 111).
   
   ??? note "Resolution"
   
       1. Verify the NFS CSI driver is running:
   
          ```bash
          kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep nfs
          ```
   
   
       2. Test NFS connectivity from a worker node:
   
          ```bash
          ssh <kube_worker> showmount -e <nfs_server_ip>
          ```
   
   
       3. Verify the PersistentVolume configuration:
   
          ```bash
          kubectl get pv -o yaml | grep -A 5 nfs
          ```
   
   
       4. Check NFS firewall rules on the NFS server:
   
          ```bash
          ssh <nfs_server> firewall-cmd --list-all | grep -E 'nfs|2049|111'
          ```
   
   
       5. If the NFS server is unreachable, verify it is on the admin network:
   
          ```bash
          ssh <kube_worker> ping <nfs_server_ip>
          ```
   
   
       !!! tip
   
           For production environments, use the PowerScale CSI driver instead of
           external NFS. See [Deploy Powerscale Csi](../HowTo/Kubernetes/deploy_powerscale_csi.rst).
   
   
   ## Calico networking issues
   
   
   ???+ note "Symptom"
   
       Pods cannot communicate with each other across nodes. `kubectl exec`
       into a pod and pinging another pod's IP fails. Calico pods may show errors
       in their logs.
   
   ??? note "Cause"
   
       - Calico pods are not running on all nodes.
       - The pod CIDR overlaps with an existing network range.
       - BGP peering is misconfigured (in BGP mode).
       - IP-in-IP or VXLAN encapsulation is blocked by network infrastructure.
   
   ??? note "Resolution"
   
       1. Check Calico pod status:
   
          ```bash
          kubectl get pods -n calico-system
          # or
          kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep calico
          ```
   
   
       2. Check Calico node status:
   
          ```bash
          kubectl get nodes -o wide
          calicoctl node status    # if calicoctl is installed
          ```
   
   
       3. Verify the pod CIDR does not overlap with existing networks:
   
          ```bash
          kubectl cluster-info dump | grep -m 1 cluster-cidr
          ```
   
   
       4. Check Calico logs for errors:
   
          ```bash
          kubectl logs -n calico-system -l k8s-app=calico-node --tail=50
          ```
   
   
       5. If encapsulation is blocked, switch Calico to VXLAN mode:
   
          ```bash
          kubectl patch felixconfiguration default \
            --type='merge' \
            -p '{"spec":{"vxlanEnabled":true,"ipipEnabled":false}}'
          ```
