**Potential Cause**: 
    * SSH key on the OIM may be outdated.
    * cloud-init might not be rendered.

**Resolution**:

   * Refresh the key using ``ssh-keygen -R <hostname/server IP>``.
   * Retry login.
   * If cloud-init is not be rendered, retry the cluster node reprovision.

⦾ **How is the gracefull shutdown of an Omnia cluster is achieved?**

**Potential Cause**: Manage OIM reboot/shutdown scenario.

**Resolution**: In the case of a planned shutdown, ensure that the OIM is shut down after the compute nodes. When powering back up, the OIM should be powered on and OpenCHAMI resumed before bringing up the compute nodes. In short, have the OIM as the first node up and the last node down.
