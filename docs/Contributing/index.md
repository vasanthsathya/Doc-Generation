# Contributing to Omnia

We encourage everyone to help us improve Omnia by contributing to the project. Contributions can be as small as documentation updates or adding example use cases, to adding commenting and properly styling code segments, all the way up to full feature contributions. We ask that contributors follow our established guidelines for contributing to the project.

This document will evolve as the project matures. Refer back regularly to stay in line with the latest contribution guidelines.

## Become a contributor

You can contribute to Omnia in several ways:

- **Code contributions** -- Fix bugs or implement features. See [Pull Request Guidelines](pull_requests.md) for the submission process.
- **Documentation** -- Improve existing documentation or add examples.
- **Bug reports** -- Report issues you encounter. See [Submitting issues](#submitting-issues) below.
- **Feature requests** -- Propose new features or enhancements.
- **Testing** -- Test Omnia on different hardware configurations, OS versions, or network topologies and report your findings.

## Submitting issues

All issues should be submitted on the [Omnia GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dell/omnia/issues) page. Before submitting a new issue, search the existing issues to ensure the problem has not already been reported.

### Report bugs

Report a bug by submitting a bug report with the following information:

1. Version of relevant software: Omnia version and Python version
2. Details of the issue explaining the problem.
3. Steps to reproduce the issue.
4. The expected outcome that was not met.
5. Supporting troubleshooting information such as log output and error messages.

### Feature requests

If you have an idea for how to improve Omnia, submit a feature request issue with:

- A description of the proposed functionality.
- The use case and expected behavior.
- Any design considerations or implementation suggestions.

## Getting started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub:

    [https://github.com/dell/omnia](https://github.com/dell/omnia)

2. **Clone your fork** locally:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/omnia.git
    cd omnia
    ```

3. **Add the upstream remote:**

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/dell/omnia.git
    ```

4. **Create a branch** from `main`. All contributions should be branched from `main`. Use the naming pattern `issue-xxxx` based on the issue you are addressing (e.g., `issue-1023`):

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b issue-<issue_number>
    ```

5. **Make your changes**, commit with sign-off, and push:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -s -m "Brief description of the change"
    git push origin issue-<issue_number>
    ```

6. **Open a pull request** on GitHub from your branch to the `main` branch of the upstream repository. See [Pull Request Guidelines](pull_requests.md) for detailed requirements.


## Signing your commits

All contributors must sign off on their commits to certify that they have permission to contribute the code. This is commonly known as the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/), which is reproduced below.

Use the `--signoff` or `-s` option when committing:
