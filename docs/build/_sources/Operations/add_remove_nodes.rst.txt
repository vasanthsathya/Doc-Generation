Add and Remove Nodes
====================


Omnia supports dynamically scaling your Slurm cluster by adding new compute
nodes or removing existing ones without disrupting running workloads. This
procedure uses the ``add_node`` and ``remove_node`` playbooks from inside the
``omnia_core`` Podman container on the OIM.


Adding compute nodes
--------------------


Use this procedure when new servers have been racked, cabled, and discovered by
the OIM, and you want to include them in the Slurm cluster.


Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


- The new nodes have been provisioned with an operating system via
  :doc:`Discover Nodes <../HowTo/Setup/discover_nodes>` and :doc:`Pxe Boot Nodes <../HowTo/Setup/pxe_boot_nodes>`.
- Network connectivity between the OIM and the new nodes is verified (SSH
  access works).
- The Slurm cluster is already operational (``slurmctld`` is running on the
  control node).


Procedure
~~~~~~~~~


1. Update the node mapping file. Add the new node entries (MAC address,
   hostname, IP) to the mapping file used during initial deployment:

.. code-block:: text

   # /omnia/input/mapping_file.csv
   AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:F1,compute-05,10.5.0.105
   AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:F2,compute-06,10.5.0.106

2. Access the omnia_core container on the OIM:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh omnia_core

3. Run the add_node playbook:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /omnia
   ansible-playbook playbooks/add_node.yml

The playbook will:

- Install and configure ``slurmd`` on each new node.
- Register the nodes with the Slurm controller.
- Apply any GPU drivers or additional packages as specified in the
  configuration.

4. Verify the new nodes are visible to Slurm:

.. code-block:: bash

   sinfo

Expected output shows the new nodes in an ``idle`` state:

.. code-block:: text

   PARTITION  AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE  NODELIST
   normal*       up   infinite      6   idle  compute-[01-06]





Removing compute nodes
----------------------


Use this procedure when decommissioning servers or temporarily removing nodes
from the scheduling pool.


Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


- You have ``root`` or ``sudo`` access to the OIM.
- No critical jobs are running on the nodes to be removed (or you are prepared
  to let them drain).


Procedure
~~~~~~~~~


1. Drain the node to allow running jobs to complete and prevent new jobs
   from being scheduled:

.. code-block:: bash

   scontrol update NodeName=compute-05 State=DRAIN Reason="Decommissioning"



   Verify the node enters the ``drained`` state:


.. code-block:: bash

   sinfo -n compute-05




.. code-block:: text

   PARTITION  AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE    NODELIST
   normal*       up   infinite      1  drained  compute-05



2. Access the omnia_core container on the OIM:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh omnia_core



3. Run the remove_node playbook:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /omnia
   ansible-playbook playbooks/remove_node.yml -e "target_nodes=compute-05"



4. Update the mapping file. Remove the decommissioned node entry from
   ``/omnia/input/mapping_file.csv`` to prevent it from being re-added in
   future operations.

5. Verify the node has been removed:

.. code-block:: bash

   sinfo

The removed node should no longer appear in the node list.



Verification
------------


After adding or removing nodes, confirm the cluster state:

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Run on: Slurm control node

   # Check overall cluster health
   sinfo

   # Verify controller sees all expected nodes
   scontrol show nodes | grep NodeName

   # Submit a test job to verify scheduling
   srun -N 1 hostname
