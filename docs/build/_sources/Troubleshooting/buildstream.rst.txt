BuildStreaM Issues
==================


Issues related to the BuildStreaM catalog-driven CI/CD deployment workflow,
including GitLab pipelines, container registry operations, catalog parsing, and
OAuth credentials.


GitLab pipeline failures
------------------------


**Symptom**

A BuildStreaM pipeline in GitLab fails with a red status indicator. The
pipeline log shows errors in one or more stages (build, deploy, test).

**Cause**

- The GitLab Runner is not registered or is offline.
- Pipeline variables (credentials, URLs) are missing or incorrect.
- The runner does not have network access to the OIM or cluster nodes.
- A previous pipeline left stale state that conflicts with the current run.

**Resolution**

1. Check the pipeline log in GitLab:

- Navigate to **CI/CD** > **Pipelines** in the BuildStreaM project.
- Click the failed pipeline, then click the failed job to see its log.

2. Verify the GitLab Runner is registered and online:

.. code-block:: bash

   gitlab-runner list
   gitlab-runner verify

3. Check pipeline variables:

- Navigate to **Settings** > **CI/CD** > **Variables** in the GitLab project.
- Verify all required variables are set (OIM IP, credentials, registry
  URL).

4. Test network connectivity from the runner to the OIM:

.. code-block:: bash

   # From the GitLab Runner host
   ping <oim_ip>
   ssh root@<oim_ip> hostname

5. If stale state is the issue, clean up and retry:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clear the runner's build cache
   gitlab-runner clear-cache

   # Retry the pipeline from GitLab UI




Registry push failures
----------------------


**Symptom**

The BuildStreaM pipeline fails during the image push stage with errors such
as:

.. code-block:: text

   Error: failed to push image: authentication required
   Error: failed to push image: denied: requested access to the resource is denied

**Cause**

- Container registry credentials are incorrect or expired.
- The registry URL in the pipeline configuration is wrong.
- The registry's TLS certificate is not trusted by the runner.
- The registry storage is full.

**Resolution**

1. Verify registry credentials:

.. code-block:: bash

   podman login <registry_url>

2. Check that the registry URL matches the pipeline configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

   grep -i registry .gitlab-ci.yml

3. If TLS is the issue, add the registry's CA certificate:

.. code-block:: bash

   cp <registry_ca.crt> /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
   update-ca-trust

Or configure Podman to trust the registry:

.. code-block:: bash

   # /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/buildstream.conf
   [[registry]]
   location = "<registry_url>"
   insecure = true    # Not recommended for production

4. Check registry storage:

.. code-block:: bash

   df -h <registry_data_dir>




Catalog parse errors
--------------------


**Symptom**

The BuildStreaM pipeline fails during the catalog parsing stage with errors
such as:

.. code-block:: text

   Error: Failed to parse catalog: invalid YAML syntax at line 42
   Error: Unknown component type 'slurm_cluser' in catalog entry

**Cause**

- The catalog YAML file has syntax errors (indentation, missing colons,
  invalid characters).
- A catalog entry references a component type that does not exist (typo).
- Required fields are missing from a catalog entry.

**Resolution**

1. Validate the catalog file syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('catalog.yml'))"

2. Use a YAML linter for more detailed error reporting:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install yamllint
   yamllint catalog.yml

3. Check for typos in component types. Valid types include:

- ``slurm_cluster``
- ``kubernetes_cluster``
- ``telemetry``
- ``authentication``
- ``storage``

4. Verify all required fields are present in each catalog entry. Refer to
   the :doc:`Update Catalog Pipeline <../HowTo/BuildStreaM/update_catalog_pipeline>` guide for the
   catalog schema.

5. After fixing errors, commit and push to trigger a new pipeline:

.. code-block:: bash

   git add catalog.yml
   git commit -m "Fix catalog syntax errors"
   git push




OAuth credential issues
-----------------------


**Symptom**

BuildStreaM operations fail with OAuth authentication errors when
communicating with GitLab or external services:

.. code-block:: text

   Error: OAuth token expired or revoked
   Error: 401 Unauthorized: invalid_token

**Cause**

- The OAuth token has expired.
- The OAuth application was deleted or its secret was rotated in GitLab.
- The token scope does not include the required permissions (``api``,
  ``read_registry``, ``write_registry``).

**Resolution**

1. Check the current token status:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     https://<gitlab_url>/api/v4/user

A ``401`` response confirms the token is invalid.

2. Generate a new personal access token in GitLab:

- Navigate to **User Settings** > **Access Tokens**.
- Create a new token with scopes: ``api``, ``read_registry``,
  ``write_registry``.

3. Update the token in pipeline variables:

- Navigate to **Settings** > **CI/CD** > **Variables**.
- Update the ``GITLAB_TOKEN`` (or equivalent) variable with the new
  token.

4. If using an OAuth application (rather than personal token):

- Navigate to **Admin Area** > **Applications** (or **User Settings** >
  **Applications**).
- Verify the application exists and note the Application ID and Secret.
- Update the pipeline variables with the new credentials.

5. Re-run the failed pipeline from the GitLab UI.
