### Known Issues

| Issue | Description | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **BuildStreaM Pipeline Retry Limitation** | When a build pipeline fails partially (e.g., one architecture succeeds while another fails due to resource constraints, network issues, or configuration problems), retrying the pipeline may result in INTERNAL_ERROR for previously completed image builds. BuildStreaM currently does not skip or reuse already-successful builds during retry operations. | If you encounter INTERNAL_ERROR during pipeline retry, start a fresh pipeline instead of retrying the failed one. Ensure adequate system resources (including 200 GB free disk space on OIM / partition) before initial pipeline execution to minimize the risk of partial failures. |

## Omnia 2.1.0.0

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **BuildStream: Catalog-Driven Build Automation** | Omnia BuildStreaM provides a comprehensive automation solution for managing infrastructure build workflows. It uses a catalog-driven approach where you define your build requirements in a structured catalog file, and BuildStreaM executes automated pipelines to create and deploy images according to your specifications. For more details, see [BuildStreaM Documentation](../HowTo/build_stream/deploy_gitlab.md). |
| **Support for Installation of Additional Packages** | Enables the installation of additional packages on the cluster nodes, allowing to extend cluster functionality with custom software and tools. For more details, see [Deploy Additional Packages](../HowTo/repo_manager/../repo_manager/deploy_additional_packages.md). |
| **Add and Remove Slurm Compute Nodes** | Provides the ability to add and remove Slurm compute nodes from the cluster, allowing for dynamic scaling of the cluster. For more details, see [Add and Remove Nodes](../Operations/add_remove_nodes.md). |
| **Support for Apptainer** | Run apptainer pull to store the SIF container image on the cluster's NFS-mounted shared storage. This ensures uniform access across all compute nodes, enabling them to run jobs from the same SIF file. For more details, see [Use Apptainer](../HowTo/orchestrator/../orchestrator/use_apptainer.md). |
| **Telemetry Collection from OME and SFM** | Enables collection of telemetry data from OpenManage Enterprise (OME) and Smart Fabric Manager (SFM), providing insights into cluster health, performance, and resource utilization. For more details, see [Deploy Telemetry](../HowTo/Telemetry/deploy_telemetry.md). |
| **PowerVault Storage Integration** | The PowerVault integration, with a preconfigured volume, provides persistent storage for critical Slurm controller components using iSCSI block storage with multipath support. This ensures data persistence for Slurm's StateSaveLocation and the MariaDB/MySQL database. |
| **InfiniBand Networking Support** | Provides comprehensive support for InfiniBand (IB) networking in HPC clusters, including automatic DOCA-OFED driver installation for NVIDIA InfiniBand cards, and static IP assignment for IB interfaces. InfiniBand Networking requires an InfiniBand subnet manager (SM) configured and running to manage the IB fabric. For more details, see [Configure InfiniBand](../HowTo/orchestrator/configure_infiniband.md). |
